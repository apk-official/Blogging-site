        <h2>Dreams: Unleashed memories</h2><hr>
        <img src="Images/Dreams Unleashed memories.jpg" alt="Dream:Unleashed memories Blog picture" class="title-picture">
        <p class="paragraph1">Dreams, explains about memories, thoughts, experiences or any incidents which is happening in our life. We can't compel that this must be our dream. Dreams are of two types. One is about thought and wishes in one's life. These are like day dreaming. Second is all about dreams happened in our sleep..These were unexpected . Anything can be in our dream.</p>
        <p class="paragraph2">To explain about it I want to share my previous experience. Some days before I saw a dream of a pshycopath try to attack me. Suddenly I wake up and saw that it was 3 o'clock in the morning. In that night I afraid a lot. I can't even step out from my bed or removing bedsheet from my head. I sweat a lot. My throat dried. But I am not able to take the bottle of water from my bed-side table. It was a horrible night. I count every seconds to sun rise. Somehow I slipped in to sleep. The next day I am okay with the reality that it is just a dream. </p>
        <p class="paragraph3">But I thought about why I saw such a dream. Because almost a year I don't even saw psychopath movie or at least don't thought about anything. After a long term of thought I made a conclusion that all these incident is happened because of that in my childhood I am afraid of pshycopaths. In my early days I saw a movie of a serial killer who killed Children. After watching it I am afraid a lot and before moving to bed I check nook and corner of bed by thinking that "is there anyone under my bed to kill me".But in that days I don't saw any dreams relating to this. But after almost 10 to 15 years it came to my memory in the form of a dream. </p>
        <p class="paragraph4">Also dreams have made a deja vu effect on one's mind. That is, sometimes we feel that incidents happened in our life may be saw somewhere else.</p>
        <p class="paragraph5">Dreams are our unleashed memories. It can be interlinked with life.</p>
