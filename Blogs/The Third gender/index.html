        <h2>The third gender</h2><hr>
        <img src="Images/Third gender.jpg" alt="The third gender title picture" class="title-picture">
        <p class="paragraph1">For the last few years one of the most discussed topic is about "transgender". To explain about who is a transgender, one should be thoroughly knows about the difference between 'Gender', 'Sex' and 'Sexuality'. Our society determined the gender of a newborn in terms of their sex. But the present circumstances proven that it was not a correct method of gender identification. It is because of that sometimes this method is wrong in some people. It means, their sex and mental condition are different. For example, the sex of a person by birth may be male but their mental condition is like a woman and vice versa. That is gender and sexuality may be different in some people. At this point we thought about the third gender; TRANSGENDER.</p>
        <p class="paragraph2">From the puranas onwards we can saw the history of a third gender example like <em>"shikandi"</em>. But the role of them in the society with little importance. The problems and sufferings of this group of people is big.From, the early years onwards transgender is neglected. We do not regard them as human beings. Even animals are treated above these third sexes.We neglected these perople not only from the society but also from their families.</p>
        <p class="paragraph4"> When the families identified their daughter or son was under this third category, mostly they tried to hide them from the society they lived. If they are not ready to accept the rules from families, then their place may be outside the house.</p>
        <p class="paragraph5">After, the supreme court verdict and other developments society changed little bit. But ignorance from job, offices and other top places made these people mentally weak.</p>
        <p class="paragraph6">It is a fact that there is a third gender. The society must accept this. For the development of the transgender, it is difficult to change the mind set of the existing society. The only way to upgrade these people is to educate the coming generation about these gender, sexuality etc. We must teach that there were not two gender-but it is three: THE TRANSGENDER....</p>
