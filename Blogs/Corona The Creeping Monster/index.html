        <h2>Corona:The Creeping Monster</h2><hr>
        <img src="Images/Corona.jpg" alt="Corona:Creeping Monster Blog picture" class="title-picture">
        <p class="paragraph1">Nowadays the life of people, revolves around the cancerous monster corona. It changes the life style, customs and every aspects of life. Today, I am going to analyse about the after effects of corona and how it positively and negatively affects the society.</p>
        <p class="paragraph2">In all words, corona is a deadly disease. But there were some positive things also happened. Let's check it out. In early days in-front of every house there is a pot filled with water to wash hands and legs after entering to the house from outside. It was a good custom. By doing this it easy to remove dirt and harmful germs from enter in to the person and house. Gradually this custom stopped. But due to corona handwash and sanitizing be a must thing. It changed as habit. </p>
        <p class="paragraph3">Similarly, In my grandma's time, marriage is considered as ritual between two families, that is why close relatives and friends be the only participants.Then this was changed and marriage became a place for show off the families richness until the flourishing of the corona virus.</p>
        <p class="paragraph4">Up to the time of corona, people are busy and there was no time to spend each other and with their families. Corona tress pass to the life of people and they have enough time to spend together, cook together, play games together, etc..</p>
        <p class="paragraph5">These are some positive impacts of corona. But there were some negative as well. One of the important matter related to this is that mental and physical state of the people changed. That is, to be live in a house without going anywhere and also without seeing anyone make the person mentally ill.This problem mainly affects kids. They are frustrated a lot because of spending their precious energy and valuable time inside the four walls of the house. They are not even see their friends and they have no way to spend. That is why children became addicted to virtual platform. They mainly spent their time with these smart gadgets and it may change their attitude and also it affects their health. Child hood is a period with full of energy. But today's kids have no way to exhaust this energy. It may affect the health of the child. </p>
        <p class="paragraph6">Change in life style became another problem regarding this matter. That is until corona there was usual routine of waking up early, had breakfast, lunch and dinner properly, doing excersice regularly, sleep early as possible, etc. But all these routines were changed and people became lazy. They wake up in the afternoon or noon time. Had food as brunch rather than breakfast and lunch. Always be lazy. Another issue is of sleeping late night. All these cause health problems. People are become unhealthy through all this changing life style. </p>
        <p class="paragraph7">Society is changed a lot with the intrusion of corona. These changes are good. Because changes may help to the growth of society. But the changes must in a healthy, harmless and positive way. We need a generation of healthy and energetic people. For that one must follow a healthy lifestyle and stay positive.</p>
